# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
print("Hello world!")
# string manipulation series
# we will print five lines of code using one print statement and \n to create new lines
print("first line\nsecond line\nthird line\nfourth line\nfifth line\n")
# first way to insert space between strings is concatenation
print("Hello" " " + "world")
# or
print( "Hello" + " " + "world" )
# second way to insert space between strings without the plus
print("Hello " "world")

# today we treated the input() function in python
# line 15 below we demonstrated putting function to another function by putting the input function side the print function
# print("Hello " + input("What is your name?") + "!")
# implementing the input function in a more readable format
# User_name = input("What is your name: \n")
# print("Hello " + User_name + "!")
# in this course we also treated commenting in python using # sign
#  Also the crl / to comment and uncomment a line of code.

# In this course session we will be learning python Variables
# Variable implementation in python
# implementing variable on a string datatype
name = "Jack"
print(name)
# implementing variable on number data type
phone_number = 234567890
# implementing variable on a boolean datatype
isSunShine = True
# implementing variable on a function
input_name = input("Enter your name")
print(input_name)
